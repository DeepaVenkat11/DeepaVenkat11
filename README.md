- ## Hi there, I'm [Your Name] 👋

I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer on a mission to build bug-free, high-quality software. With a solid foundation in manual testing and a passion for automation, I love diving into code to build scalable testing solutions.

- 🔭 I’m currently building a full E2E testing framework for an e-commerce demo site using **Playwright**.
- ⚙️ I use `JavaScript/TypeScript`, `Playwright`, `Postman`, and `Jira` daily.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about **Performance Testing with Jmeter** and **CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions & jenkins**.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to QA, from writing test cases to automating API endpoints!
